> **Active plan: `~/Documents/Projects/.plans/megalodon/governor-hook-permission-architecture-2026-05-25-tasks.md`** (warp-tier). Governor `PreToolUse` hook replaces the screen-scraping permission system; decommissions `permission_watcher.py`. Supersedes the §1b auto-approver. **PHASE 1 COMPLETE 2026-05-25** (subagent-driven: implementer→spec→quality→final, all approved): Task 1.1 `megalodon_ui/governor/policy.py` (pure fail-closed policy engine) + Task 1.2 `megalodon_ui/governor/hook.py` (PreToolUse stdin→decide→stdout + secret-sanitized `.fleet/governor-log` audit). 182 tests (policy 162 / hook 20), ruff + vulture clean. Review caught + closed 4 CRITICAL bypasses (grouping/keyword head-hiding, override cross-segment leak, backslash-newline floor splice, repr-escaped audit-log leak). **PHASE 2 CODE COMPLETE 2026-05-25** (additive — allowlist kept as fallback pending the REPL gate): 2.1 `.claude/governor-settings.json` + `scripts/governor_hook.py` shim (decoupled to run under bare python3) + validity test; 2.2 `--settings` wired into all 3 claude argv paths (live-REPL + /followup respawn) via one `governor_kwargs` gate + `governor_enabled` kill-switch + fail-loud `preflight_governor`; 2.3 canary sentinel + fleet-side `governor_canary_selftest` (aborts spawn loudly if the governor isn't enforcing) + agent-side launch.md canary; 2.5 reattach marks `ungoverned` (governed-marker keyed off spawn identity, fail-toward-ungoverned, no in-flight kill). Full suite 1327 passed, ruff + vulture clean; real-`claude` e2e (`test_governor_hook_e2e.py`, isolated) 3-pass/2-xfail — canary-deny + floor-deny-beats-hook-allow + safe-allow verified end-to-end. **✅ OPERATOR GATE PASSED 2026-05-25** — both recorded PASS: `verifications/2026-05-25-governor-repl-validation.md` (live interactive REPL: canary + sudo denied, benign command runs with NO prompt → **risk 8.1 resolved**, hook-allow suffices in a REPL, so allowlist removal is unblocked) AND `verifications/2026-05-25-governor-canary-rollout.md` (Task 2.6 single-lane live canary through the real spawn path: preflight + canary-selftest passed, live argv carried `--settings`, `A.governed` marker written, governor-log accrued deny→allow→deny, no stall). **P3 may proceed.** **Operator-validated P3.2 must-fix:** during the canary the board showed the governed lane as IDLE/no-activity — because the ActivityWall's permission-watcher source goes SILENT under the governor (no prompts to observe) and nothing tails the governor-log yet. P3.2 must wire the ActivityWall to `.fleet/governor-log-*.jsonl` so governed-lane deny/allow activity is actually visible (not just swap one silent source for another). **PHASE 3 COMPLETE 2026-05-25:** 3.1 decommissioned the `permission_watcher` backend (module + `/api/v1/permission_prompts` endpoints + lifespan wiring + `_V92_GATED_PATH_RE` gate-regex removed; watcher tests deleted, `test_permission_watcher_decommission.py` regression guard added); 3.2 reshaped `/api/v1/lanes/stale` (dropped `pending_approval`, added the `governor_blocked` deny-loop list — `_compute_governor_blocked`, ≥5 denies/60s, excluded from `stale_lanes`) and wired the ActivityWall `_source_governor_log` (6th source, tails `.fleet/governor-log-*.jsonl`, event `type:"governor"`) — the operator-validated visibility fix; 3.3 moved the `approval-rules.json` consumer to the governor as an audited allow-override and removed the `--allowedTools` allowlist + `_is_unbounded_tool`/`_FORBIDDEN_HEAD_CMDS` (BREAKING; see HISTORY). **PHASE 4 COMPLETE 2026-05-25:** 4.1 removed the permission-prompt banner from `board.js` and repurposed `blockedLanes` to the `governor_blocked` list (BLOCKED pill, precedence BLOCKED > STALE > RUNNING/IDLE, SSE never overwrites BLOCKED); 4.2 `activity_wall.js` renders the governor `type:"governor"` events + e2e overhaul. **PHASE 5 COMPLETE 2026-05-25 (this pass):** docs reconciled to the implemented governor (README governor section + activity-wall/approve-remember/operator-allowlist fixes; HISTORY 3.1/3.2/Phase-4/Phase-5 entries; v10-readiness §1b; this tasks.md). **GOVERNOR MIGRATION DONE — Phases 1–5 complete and verified (full suite green at each phase; live REPL + canary gate PASSED).** The fleet is now **Claude-only** (the governor hook is a Claude Code feature; non-claude harnesses are not governed — accepted tradeoff).
>
> **Governor follow-ups / tech-debt (deferred — future work, NOT done):**
>   - **(pending)** Shared `_tail_daily_jsonl(filename_fmt, build_event)` helper to de-duplicate `_source_inject_log`/`_source_governor_log` in `activity_wall.py` (3.2 quality review).
>   - **(pending)** Distinct `GOV-BLOCK` board pill kind — governor-blocked currently reuses the BLOCKED label/pill; a dedicated pill + color would disambiguate it from a task-blocked lane (4.1 design decision).
>   - **(pending)** Robustness: a transient `/api/v1/lanes/stale` fetch failure clears `blockedLanes` for one ~30s poll cycle (the BLOCKED pill flickers to RUNNING then self-heals) — only clear `blockedLanes` on a successful poll (4.1 quality review).
>   - **(pending)** Persistent `http`-type governor for per-call latency — a cold `command` hook currently fires per tool call; measure first before optimizing (plan §7/§8.2).
>   - **(pending)** Lane settings isolation (controlled `HOME`/settings per lane) for full hook isolation, vs the current `--settings` merge (plan CR-8/§3.3).
>   - **(pending)** Sub-agent governance — `Task`/`Agent` spawns are denied in the MVP (`subagent-spawn`); design governed sub-agent spawning (plan CR-7).
>   - **(pending)** MCP/A2A tool governance as the tool surface grows.
>
> **Plan (narrator summary board — PHASES 1–4 COMPLETE, on origin/main 2026-05-24):** Board is the default fleet view at `/`; `grid.js` deleted; narrator wired into the lifespan. Full gate green: 961 Python passed / 34 skipped / 3 xfailed; 12 isolated (`--forked`); Playwright 159 passed / 9 skipped. Each task ran implementer→spec-review→quality-review. Phase commits: P1 `ef4ea18`, P2 `2d7211e`, P3 `41d3984`, P4 `19b1eb1`+`1b460bc`+fixes. `~/Documents/Projects/.plans/megalodon/narrator-summary-board-2026-05-23.md` · tasks: `~/Documents/Projects/.plans/megalodon/narrator-summary-board-2026-05-23-tasks.md` · spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-23-narrator-summary-board-design.md`.
> **Follow-ups (deferred, now resolved 2026-05-24):**
>   - narrator-phrase-on-"Last" (OQ1 — IMPLEMENTED `6ca2b1e`); empirical model-quality validation pending dogfood.
>   - CR-4 task-blocked pill — DONE (`5ca9525`); state="blocked" when lane has blocked task; BLOCKED pill + precedence working.
>   - optional staleness modal — DONE (`5ca9525`); click STALE pill opens details modal.
>   - WebKit send-debounce skip in `test_lane_detail:130` — RESOLVED (`bd03072`); was real bug (timer arming order), fixed + un-skipped; test passes both chromium + webkit.
>   - Preflight socket-budget validation — RESOLVED (`c3a2acb`); rejects over-long slugs up front instead of failing late at spawn.
> **Dogfood run scaffolded:** `runs/2026-05-24T22-14Z--v10-prep` (v10 refactor scoping) queued but not yet launched.
>
> **Active plan (tool-surface hardening — IMPLEMENTED + PUSHED + GATE-VALIDATED 2026-05-24):** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-22-agent-tool-surface-policy.md` · tasks: `~/Documents/Projects/.plans/megalodon/agent-tool-surface-policy-2026-05-22-tasks.md`. All 8 tasks done and on `origin/main` (`999088b` allowlist, `2748eab` launch.md, `a9a3e84` orientation-fix + auto-open). 56 policy tests green; full suite 858/0. **The "pending manual gate before push" was already moot — the work was pushed; this entry is corrected from the stale prior wording.**
> **Fresh-spawn acceptance gate — RUN 2026-05-24 (claude v2.1.142, Opus 4.7), hardening VALIDATED:** spawned single Opus AUDIT lanes (`tsgate`, `tsgate2`). Confirmed: (1) Read-tool orientation — Step 0 (`a9a3e84`) conclusively stops the v94h `ls`/`cd`/`tail` orientation prompts; (2) **bounded calls auto-approve** — `scripts/queue_submit.py … status` ran prompt-free; (3) **compounds/extra-shell correctly gate** (the desired CV-2 property). Three agent-habit findings surfaced + fixed/recorded below. Decision (operator, 2026-05-24): **ACCEPT — hardening works as designed**; remaining prompts are agents decorating bounded calls with shell, addressed best-effort in launch.md.
>   - **Finding A (HIGH — FIXED):** run-dir missions had no `scripts/`, so the allowlisted relative `scripts/<tool>` couldn't resolve from the spawn cwd (= run dir) → first bounded call would prompt. Fix: `new_run.sh` now symlinks `scripts/` into each run dir (`../../scripts`); `launch.md:5` corrected to "mission = your cwd = the run dir." Regression test `test_scaffold_links_scripts_for_run_dir_cwd`.
>   - **Finding B/C (MEDIUM — best-effort guidance):** agents wrap bounded calls in extra shell that gates — `cat .claude/settings.json | head` (B), `scripts/claim.sh … ; echo "exit=$?"` (C). Both are the hardening *correctly* gating compounds. `launch.md` Step 0 reinforced: don't inspect the allowlist; invoke bounded tools bare with nothing appended.
>   - **Finding (HIGH — FIXED 2026-05-24):** `new_run.sh` now validates the prospective `<run>/.fleet/tmux.sock` path against the 100-byte guard (`SOCKET_PATH_LIMIT_BYTES`) and refuses an over-budget slug up front with budget math (bytes-over + chars-to-trim), instead of letting `launch_fleet.sh --spawn` fail late at exit 10. Bypass via `MEGALODON_SKIP_SOCKET_BUDGET=1`. Tests: `test_rejects_slug_whose_socket_path_exceeds_budget`, `test_socket_budget_limit_matches_product_constant`. Origin finding: `.archive/2026-05-23T20-24Z--v94h/findings/operator-OPS-new_run-socket-path-no-validation-*.md`.
>
> **Dev gates (pre-commit hook — ADDED 2026-05-24):** `hooks/pre-commit` (activate per clone with `git config core.hooksPath hooks`) runs **ruff on staged `.py`** (pinned `ruff==0.15.14`) + a **vulture dead-code scan** across `megalodon_ui`/`scripts` (config in `pyproject.toml [tool.vulture]`; `signum/frame/exc_*` ignored as required-by-signature). **Tests intentionally NOT run on commit** (operator decision: CI owns the suite). Bypass: `git commit --no-verify`.
>   - **RESOLVED 2026-05-24 (commit 5033054) — lint debt cleared:** 17 whole-tree ruff errors fixed (E741 ambiguous `l`→`lane` ×6, E401 split imports ×2, F841 unused locals ×2, E402 ×5 — hoisted `applier.py` imports + `# noqa: E402` on deliberate section-local test imports). The hook can now be moved to whole-tree lint if desired.
>   - **RESOLVED 2026-05-24 — gate parity complete:** CI `-p forked`→`--forked` (`0064e60`); CI ruff pinned to `ruff==0.15.14` matching the pre-commit hook + a vulture dead-code CI step added (`test.yml`). Local hooks ≡ CI for lint + dead-code + forked-isolation.

# Tasks — Run 2 (make-it-work)

Format: `[ ] [LANE-X] <task-id> — <description>`

States: `[ ]` open · `[claimed: <agent-id> @ <UTC>]` · `[done: <agent-id> @ <UTC>]`

Claim via `mkdir claims/<task-id>` per RULE 2. Use ASCII task IDs only (per v8 Edit 3): `P2-A-to-F` not `P2-A→F`.

Task IDs encode phase and lane per MISSION.md task-assignment matrix.

---

## PHASE 1 — PLAN (Pass-1 fresh eyes; do NOT read other lanes' plans)

- [done: agent-dcbc @ 2026-05-16T17:39Z] [LANE-A] `P1-A` — AUDIT plan: scan run-1 archive for what AUDIT got right/wrong; design run-2 audit methodology; plan v8.1-candidate doc structure (if recurring failures suggest spec gaps). Output: `findings/<agent>-A-P1-audit-plan-<UTC>.md`
- [done: agent-fec0 @ 2026-05-16T17:38Z] [LANE-B] `P1-B` — ARCHITECT plan: design `megalodon_ui/` package structure; spec `make_app(mission_dir=)` factory contract; design the 4 missing POST endpoint UI wiring patterns. Output: `findings/<agent>-B-P1-arch-plan-<UTC>.md`
- [done: agent-84f2 @ 2026-05-16T17:39Z] [LANE-C] `P1-C` — BACKEND plan: design `megalodon_ui/primitives.py` API (enumerate from `ui/tests/unit/test_protocol_primitives.py` imports — `is_stale`, `try_claim`, `validate_signal`, and any others); design `make_app(mission_dir=)` factory wrapping current `ui/server.py`'s app; plan SSE payload shape fixes. Output: `findings/<agent>-C-P1-backend-plan-<UTC>.md`
- [done: agent-2e7a @ 2026-05-16T17:40Z] [LANE-D] `P1-D` — FRONTEND plan: scan run-1's `ui/static/pages/*.js` to inventory what's wired vs what's not; design the 4 missing POST endpoint UI flows; plan Playwright integration. Output: `findings/<agent>-D-P1-frontend-plan-<UTC>.md`
- [done: agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T17:43Z] [LANE-E] `P1-E` — TEST plan: enumerate ALL tests in `ui/tests/{unit,integration,e2e}` and what each needs to actually execute (not SKIP); plan Playwright headless + UI-screenshot artifact production; design test report format. Output: `findings/<agent>-E-P1-test-plan-<UTC>.md`
- [done: agent-9bba @ 2026-05-16T17:41Z] [LANE-F] `P1-F` — META plan: observation framework targeting run-2's specific risk (PHASE-RUN+HEAL behavior + PHASE-OPERATOR-ACCEPTANCE gating). Output: `findings/<agent>-F-P1-meta-plan-<UTC>.md`

## PHASE 2 — CHALLENGE (directed cycle A→F→E→D→C→B→A)

- [done: agent-dcbc @ 2026-05-16T17:48Z] [LANE-A] `P2-A-to-F` — AUDIT challenges META plan. Output: `findings/<agent>-A-P2-challenge-of-meta-<UTC>.md`

### PHASE 2.5 — Plan-v2 reconciliation

- [done: agent-dcbc @ 2026-05-16T17:56Z] [LANE-A] `P2.5-A` — AUDIT plan-v2 incorporating ARCHITECT challenge.
- [done: agent-fec0 @ 2026-05-16T17:55Z] [LANE-B] `P2.5-B` — ARCHITECT plan-v2 incorporating BACKEND challenge.

- [done: agent-9bba @ 2026-05-16T17:57Z] [LANE-F] `P2.5-F` — META plan-v2 incorporating AUDIT challenge.

## PHASE 3 — BUILD

- [done: agent-dcbc @ 2026-05-16T19:11Z] [LANE-A] `P3-A` — AUDIT writes `docs/v8.1-candidate.md` IF the run surfaces protocol spec gaps. Otherwise produces a "v8-stable-after-run-2" attestation. Output: `docs/v8.1-candidate.md` OR `findings/<agent>-A-P3-v8-attestation-<UTC>.md`
- [done: agent-fec0 @ 2026-05-16T19:08Z] [LANE-B] `P3-B` — ARCHITECT writes `ui/SPEC-v2.md` (incremental delta) + `ui/adrs/ADR-006-make_app-factory.md`
- [done: agent-84f2 @ 2026-05-16T19:36Z] [LANE-C] `P3-C` — BACKEND builds `megalodon_ui/` package. **Publish stub in tick 1-2 so TEST can integrate against it.** Output: `megalodon_ui/__init__.py` + `megalodon_ui/primitives.py` + `megalodon_ui/server.py` (with `make_app(mission_dir=Path)` factory) + fixes to `ui/server.py` for SSE payload shapes (run-1 P4-C→D V2).
- [done: agent-2e7a @ 2026-05-16T19:19Z] [LANE-D] `P3-D` — FRONTEND wires the 4 unwired POST endpoints in `ui/static/pages/*.js` (inject-challenge, phase-flip, mission-status, inject-task). Each must have form + success/error toast + Playwright-testable `data-testid` hooks.
- [done: agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T19:54Z] [LANE-E] `P3-E` — TEST updates test code so imports succeed against new `megalodon_ui` package; adds Playwright headless smoke tests; ensures all tests REACH ASSERTION (no SKIPs).
- [done: agent-9bba @ 2026-05-16T19:09Z] [LANE-F] `P3-F` — META mid-mission report on PHASE-RUN behavior. Output: `findings/<agent>-F-P3-mid-mission-meta-<UTC>.md`

## PHASE 4 — VERIFY (rotated pairings; no self-verification)

- [done: agent-dcbc @ 2026-05-16T20:01Z] [LANE-A] `P4-A-to-B` — AUDIT verifies ARCHITECT SPEC-v2 honors v8 semantics.
- [done: agent-fec0 @ 2026-05-16T20:00Z] [LANE-B] `P4-B-to-E` — ARCHITECT verifies TEST coverage maps to SPEC-v2.
- [done: agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T20:06Z] [LANE-E] `P4-E-to-C` — TEST verifies BACKEND code (megalodon_ui package + ui/server.py fixes).
- [done: agent-84f2 @ 2026-05-16T20:10Z] [LANE-C] `P4-C-to-D` — BACKEND verifies FRONTEND consumes the 4 new endpoints correctly.
- [done: agent-2e7a @ 2026-05-16T20:00Z] [LANE-D] `P4-D-to-A` — FRONTEND verifies AUDIT's v8.1-candidate (or attestation).
- [done: agent-9bba @ 2026-05-16T20:03Z] [LANE-F] `P4-F-to-ALL` — META interim verify; FINAL-RUN-CAPSTONE happens post-OPERATOR-ACCEPTANCE.

## PHASE 5 — RUN (execution verification — NEW in v8)

Auto-claim by pairing matrix (no self-verification). Failure injects PHASE-HEAL repair task. **Budget per RUN task: 3 HEAL cycles OR 30-min wall-clock.** Exceed → `BLOCKED-DEGRADED`.

- [done: agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T20:10Z] [LANE-E] `P5-RUN-PRIMITIVES` — TEST runs `uv run --with pytest --with fastapi --with 'uvicorn[standard]' --with sse-starlette --with pyyaml --with httpx --with pytest-asyncio pytest ui/tests/unit -v`. **MUST exit 0 with 0 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED.** Output transcript to `findings/<agent>-E-P5-RUN-primitives-<UTC>.txt`. On failure: inject `[REPAIR-PRIMITIVES-<n>]` task with transcript embedded.
- [done: agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T20:11Z] [LANE-E] `P5-RUN-INTEGRATION` — TEST runs `uv run --with ... pytest ui/tests/integration -v`. Same exit criteria. Output transcript.
- [done: agent-2e7a @ 2026-05-16T20:15Z] [LANE-D] `P5-RUN-UI-RENDER` — FRONTEND launches `uv run --with fastapi --with 'uvicorn[standard]' --with sse-starlette --with pyyaml python ui/server.py --mission-dir ui/tests/fixtures/fix-medium --port 8765 &`, waits 3s, runs Playwright headless `goto('http://127.0.0.1:8765')`, asserts page title + 6 lane rows visible + **0 console errors**. Takes screenshot to `findings/<agent>-D-P5-RUN-ui-render-<UTC>.png`.
- [done: agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T21:43Z — BLOCKED-DEGRADED — 7 PASSED / 9 FAILED final after 3 HEAL cycles + retroactive verify post-REPAIR-11; supersedes @21:40Z close which was based on pre-REPAIR-11 transcript; see `findings/agent-43d9-E-P5-RUN-MUTATIONS-E2E-TERMINAL-FINAL-2026-05-16T21-43Z.md`] [LANE-E] `P5-RUN-MUTATIONS-E2E` — TEST runs Playwright e2e that exercises all 6 POST endpoints (signal, reclaim, inject-challenge, phase-flip, mission-status, inject-task). All must return success codes. Output transcript + screenshots.

## PHASE-HEAL REPAIRS (per Edit 21 — injected when P5-RUN-* fails)

- [done: agent-84f2 @ 2026-05-16T20:30Z] [LANE-C] `REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-1-SSE` — BACKEND: fix SSE `status-change` event delivery so UI receives event within ~3s of file mutation. Affects 5-8 e2e tests that timeout @30s waiting for UI to reflect POST'd mutation. Per BE STATUS:11 self-diagnosis: switch `/api/v1/events` `StreamingResponse` → `EventSourceResponse` (sse-starlette per-event flush) OR add periodic flush via keepalive comments. Re-verify by running existing `test_sse_stream_emits_status_change_on_file_touch` (currently XFAIL strict; should XPASS after fix). Transcript: `findings/agent-43d9-E-P5-RUN-mutations-e2e-2026-05-16T20-12Z.txt`. Inject by agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T20:24Z. HEAL cycle 1 of 3. **SCOPE-BROADENED at claim**: BE re-diagnosis on detailed transcript read — *primary* root cause is **missing `StaticFiles` mount in `megalodon_ui/server.py`** (`ui/static/index.html:8,60-62` ref `/static/css/base.css`, `/static/js/{store,sse,app}.js` → all 404 → no JS loads → no `data-testid` elements ever render → ALL 16 tests fail). Legacy `ui/server.py:1434` has the mount; my factory does not. SSE flush is *secondary* (only matters after JS loads). Will ship both fixes in this claim. NOTE TO LANE-D: many of your REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-1-FE failures may auto-resolve after static mount lands — recommend waiting until I close before re-classifying.
- [done: agent-2e7a @ 2026-05-16T20:43Z] [LANE-D] `REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-1-FE` — FRONTEND: fix selector/data-testid + fixture-render gaps for fast-fail tests (test_status_view × 4: lane-row, stale-styling, last-utc live-update, task-card; test_failure_modes × 4: stuck-flip warning, recovery-action, claim-collision panel, history-drift glyph). Tests fail at ~5s suggesting either rendered DOM missing the expected `data-testid` attributes OR fixture data shape mismatch. Cross-ref fixtures at `ui/tests/fixtures/fix-medium*` per `_gen.py`. Transcript: same as above. Inject by agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T20:24Z. HEAL cycle 1 of 3.
- [done: agent-84f2 @ 2026-05-16T20:44Z] [LANE-C] `REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-2-SPA-CATCHALL` — BACKEND: add SPA route catch-all so `/tasks`, `/findings`, `/mission`, `/signals` serve the same `index.html` shell (client-side router takes over). Currently `megalodon_ui/server.py` only defines `@app.get("/")`; 7 e2e tests `page.goto()` SPA paths directly → 404. Affects: `test_failure_modes.spec.ts:22,31,39,48` (`/mission` ×3, `/tasks` ×1) + `test_status_view.spec.ts:37,46,55` (`/tasks` ×1, `/findings` ×2). Triggered by SIGNAL-FE-1 (`findings/agent-2e7a-D-SIGNAL-FE-1-spa-routes-2026-05-16T20-36Z.md`, MAJOR) from agent-2e7a @ 2026-05-16T20:36Z. **Atomic-claim ceremony fixed**: `mkdir claims/REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-2-SPA-CATCHALL/ + owner.txt` AND TASKS bracket (defensive both-and per mea-culpa from REPAIR-1-SSE drift). HEAL cycle 1 of 3 (still within HEAL-1 budget — same trigger event).

### HEAL CYCLE 2 (triggered @ 2026-05-16T20:53Z by re-run residuals — 3 PASSED / 13 FAILED)

- [done: agent-2e7a @ 2026-05-16T21:19Z] [LANE-D] `REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-3-ACTION-PANEL` — FRONTEND: fix orchestrator action panel render — 6 mutation tests in `test_orchestrator_actions.spec.ts:{16,29,41,61,75,89}` ALL time out 30s on `page.locator('[data-testid="action-X"]').click()`. Test setup navigates to `/mission`, sets `localStorage.controlMode='true'`, reloads. Testids exist in `ui/static/pages/mission.js:514+` (`action-inject-challenge`, `action-reclaim-lane`, `action-post-signal`, etc) but never become clickable. Hypothesis: controlMode flip-on-load doesn't trigger panel rebuild, OR initial paint hides under controlMode=false then localStorage+reload sequence races. Check `store.set("ui.controlMode")` subscription + render gating in `mission.js`. Affects tests T-A-CH-e2e, T-A-RC-e2e, T-A-SG-e2e, T-R11-a-e2e, T-A-IT-e2e, T-A-MS-e2e. Transcript: `findings/agent-43d9-E-P5-RUN-mutations-e2e-2026-05-16T20-50Z.txt` lines 159-326. Inject by agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T20:53Z. HEAL cycle 2 of 3.
- [done: agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T20:58Z] [LANE-E] `REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-4-FIXTURE-OVERRIDE` — TEST: switch failure-mode tests to use `fix-medium-failure-modes` fixture. Per SIGNAL-FE-2 (`findings/agent-2e7a-D-SIGNAL-FE-2-fixture-override-2026-05-16T20-36Z.md`, MAJOR), 3 tests fail because playwright config defaults all to `fix-medium` but `test_failure_modes:21/38/47` need fixture-specific lock dirs / claim collisions / drift entries. Fix: convert `playwright.config.ts` `webServer:` single → array of 2 webServers (ports 8765+8766) + 2 projects with testMatch split (chromium-default vs chromium-failure-modes). Affects T-FX-FAILMODE-a (stuck-flip), T-FX-FAILMODE-b (non-canonical-panel), T-FX-FAILMODE-c (HISTORY-drift). Inject by agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T20:53Z. HEAL cycle 2 of 3.
- [done: agent-84f2 @ 2026-05-16T21:18Z (retroactive-recovery: claimed @21:15Z after 18min silence, shipped + closed inside HEAL-2 budget)] [LANE-C] `REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-5-STATUS-VIEW` — BACKEND (RE-OWNED per BE STATUS:11 pre-diagnosis + ARCH SPEC-v2 §3-quater anchor): ship 2 api-contract gaps. (a) `parse_status` must add `staleness_seconds: float` + `is_stale: bool` (RULE-1 15-min threshold, computed from `now_utc - parse(last_utc)`) — fixes `test_status_view:16` stale row styling via FE `dashboard.js:115,187`. (b) Add `@app.get("/api/v1/tasks")` returning `{phases: [{name, tasks:[{id, lane, state, ...}]}]}` parsed from TASKS.md bracket grammar — fixes `test_status_view:36` `task-card-*` count by populating `tasks.js:417,452` store reads. **Residual (c)(d) reclassified as fixture-class per BE STATUS:11**: `test_status_view:45` severity filter likely needs MAJOR-severity findings in `fix-medium/findings/` frontmatter (TEST/fixture scope); `test_status_view:53` scratch chip needs `.scratch.md` files present in fixture (zero today per `ls`). Will inject `REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-6-FIXTURE-DATA` for LANE-E (mine) if residuals after BE close. BE pre-drafted ~30 LOC. Inject by agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T20:53Z; re-owned LANE-D → LANE-C by agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T21:03Z. HEAL cycle 2 of 3.

### HEAL CYCLE 3 (triggered @ 2026-05-16T21:25Z — HEAL-2 re-run still 3/16 PASS but failure types progressed; FINAL cycle in 3-cycle cap)

Reclassify finding: `findings/agent-43d9-E-P5-RUN-mutations-e2e-HEAL2-RECLASSIFY-2026-05-16T21-25Z.md`. Transcript: `findings/agent-43d9-E-P5-RUN-mutations-e2e-2026-05-16T21-22Z.txt`. Progress: FE controlMode fix unblocked all 6 orchestrator initial-clicks; BE staleness/tasks fix changed test #8 from "0 cards" to "wrong count"; fixture-override routing works. Remaining failures are mostly downstream (form mechanics, fixture content, FE wiring).

- [done: agent-2e7a @ 2026-05-16T21:32Z] [LANE-D] `REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-7-ACTION-FORM-WIRING` — FRONTEND: fix form mechanics for orchestrator tests. **Test #1 T-A-CH-e2e** now fails on `challenge-finding-picker > option:nth(1)` — element "is not visible" because tests use `option.click()` but `<option>` inside `<select>` requires `selectOption()` instead. Spec tests need update OR FE picker must be `<div>` + roving-tabindex pattern (not native `<select>`). **Tests #3 T-A-SG-e2e** also hangs on selectOption — verify dropdown is populated. **Tests #4/#5/#6** progress past actions; fail at downstream assertions (toContainText/toBeVisible) — verify form-submission result-state matches what spec asserts (success toast text, task-card appearance, etc.). 6 tests affected. HEAL cycle 3 of 3. Inject by agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T21:25Z.
- [done: agent-2e7a @ 2026-05-16T21:32Z] [LANE-D] `REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-8-STATUS-STALE-WIRING` — FRONTEND: investigate why test_status_view:16 stale styling still fails after BE shipped `staleness_seconds`/`is_stale`. Either (a) FE `dashboard.js` doesn't translate `is_stale: true` → `data-stale="true"` attribute on `lane-row-{LANE}`, OR (b) `fix-medium` fixture has no lanes that exceed 15min staleness threshold. Cross-check: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1/status | jq` against running server to see if `is_stale` true for any row. Test #8 `not.toHaveCount(0)` may also need FE wiring check (task-cards may exist but wrong shape). HEAL cycle 3 of 3. Inject by agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T21:25Z.
- [done: agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T21:29Z] [LANE-E] `REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-9-FIXTURE-DATA` — TEST: add fixture content for severity-filter + scratch tests. (a) Test #9 `filter-severity-MAJOR` needs at least one MAJOR-severity finding in `fix-medium/findings/`; check current files via `grep -l 'severity: MAJOR' ui/tests/fixtures/fix-medium/findings/`. Add one if absent. (b) Test #10 scratch chip needs at least one `.scratch.md` file in `fix-medium/findings/`; add via `_gen.py` or manual touch. HEAL cycle 3 of 3. Inject by agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T21:25Z.
- [done: agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T21:29Z (VERIFIED-NO-CHANGE — fixture content complete)] [LANE-E] `REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-10-FAILURE-MODES-FIXTURE-CONTENT` — TEST: verify `fix-medium-failure-modes` fixture has expected state for 3 failure-mode tests. Inspect: (a) stuck-flip lock dir presence (`.mission-events/phase-flip-lock`?); (b) `claims/P2-C→B/` directory existence (multi-form claim collision); (c) 3 drift-shaped HISTORY entries. If missing, augment fixture via `_gen.py` OR manual files. HEAL cycle 3 of 3. Inject by agent-43d9 @ 2026-05-16T21:25Z.
- [done: agent-84f2 @ 2026-05-16T21:40Z (DOUBLE-MEA-CULPA recovery: retracted @21:30Z, un-retracted @21:36Z after empirical verification, shipped+closed @21:40Z = 4min SLA)] [LANE-C] `REPAIR-MUTATIONS-E2E-11-STATE-ENDPOINT` — BACKEND: add `@app.get("/api/v1/state")` returning aggregate `{status, tasks, findings, signals, mission, config}` per `store.js:193-217 hydrate()`. **Empirical ground truth**: `grep -n '/api/v1/state' ui/server.py` returns 2 hits (legacy server line 916 defines the route); same grep on `megalodon_ui/server.py` returns 0. UI-RENDER passed against legacy because of this endpoint; MUTATIONS-E2E uses factory. Originally injected by agent-43d9 @21:29Z, retracted @21:33Z per my mea-culpa, **re-claimed by agent-84f2 @21:36Z with empirical verification**. HEAL cycle 3 of 3.

## PHASE-OPERATOR-ACCEPTANCE (NEW in v8 post-run-1)

Auto-flips when all `P5-RUN-*` are EXEC-PASS. Workers HALT and wait.

### OPERATOR-ACCEPTANCE TASKS

- [ ] [ANY-LANE] `OPERATOR-ACCEPTANCE-REQUEST` — first worker to enter the phase writes a summary task here with: deliverable summary, test transcripts (paths), screenshot paths, outstanding issues. Then ALL lanes set state to `idle | awaiting OPERATOR-ACK`. **No new claims.**

- [OPERATOR-DEGRADED-ACK] by orchestrator-Claude (representing operator David @ Zero Delta LLC) @ 2026-05-16T21:50Z — Run-2 mission ACCEPTED WITH DEGRADED status. Rationale: final tally 7/16 e2e PASS (43.75%) + 25 PASS + 1 XFAIL unit/integration + UI renders cleanly with 0 console errors + 41KB screenshot artifact. Net progress 3→7 across 3 HEAL cycles + bonus REPAIR-11 (Edit-21 validated). 9 residuals are user-visible and well-diagnosed (4 FE form-submit gate, 2 status_view, 3 failure-mode-fixture); these become run-3 work under v9 protocol. Run-2's primary deliverable was protocol validation: 53+ v8.1 candidates harvested from execution evidence (vs run-1's 0 from doc review), 3 SPEC-FIRST HEAL addenda shipped (§3-bis SSE / §3-ter SPA / §3-quater /tasks+status), 4-cascading-HEAL pattern documented, Edit-22 retract-reversibility gap (META-OBS-41) and REPAIR-RE-UNDERTAKE pattern (META-OBS-42) surfaced. Workers: flip PHASE-OPERATOR-ACCEPTANCE → PHASE-DRAINING with degraded flag. META: write FINAL-RUN-CAPSTONE referencing this ACK. AUDIT: write Pass-3 RECONSIDERED-append to v8.1-candidate ledger. All other lanes: heartbeat through DRAINING → COMPLETE → halt /loop per launch.md §8.

Phase exits when one of:
- `[OPERATOR-ACK]` task appears here → flip to DRAINING
- `[OPERATOR-REJECT]` + `[REPAIR-<n>]` tasks appear → flip back to PHASE-HEAL
- `[OPERATOR-DEGRADED-ACK]` → flip to DRAINING with degraded flag

The orchestrator-Claude (or human operator) injects one of these tasks.

## CHALLENGE TASKS

(workers may self-assign CHALLENGEs on 3+ lane converged findings per TIER 2; orchestrator may inject)

---

## CROSS-LANE / SECONDARY TASK POOL

(claimable by any drained lane; tag `[CROSS]`; only after primary lane work is done for the current phase)

- [ ] [CROSS] `S-1` — Compare run-1 RR-1 patch vs what run-2 produces; quantify reduction in defects. Output: `findings/<agent>-CROSS-S1-run-comparison-<UTC>.md`
- [ ] [CROSS] `S-2` — Audit `.archive/2026-05-16T17-06Z--megalodon-self-improvement-run1/findings/` for failure modes v8 didn't address. Output: `findings/<agent>-CROSS-S2-v8-coverage-<UTC>.md`
- [ ] [CROSS] `S-3` — Add tests for §9.10 Origin/CSRF/localhost-bind exercise (run-1 ARCH P4-B→E gap). Output: `ui/tests/integration/test_auth.py` + run-evidence.
- [ ] [CROSS] `S-4` — Add SSE-timing test exercising 300ms file-watch vs 2.5s poll backstop. Output: `ui/tests/integration/test_sse_timing.py` + run-evidence.
- [ ] [CROSS] `S-5` — Add concurrent-write CAS test for ADR-001 (run-1 §9.4 gap). Output: `ui/tests/integration/test_cas_concurrent.py` + run-evidence.
- [done: agent-2e7a @ 2026-05-16T18:31Z] [CROSS] `S-6` — Track operator-friction events in run-2 (any moment where operator-Claude had to intervene). Output: `findings/<agent>-CROSS-S6-operator-friction-<UTC>.md`
- [ ] [CROSS] `S-7` — Devil's-advocate CHALLENGE on the entire run-2 deliverable set (claimable in PHASE-VERIFY+1 by any lane). Output: `findings/<agent>-CROSS-S7-meta-challenge-<UTC>.md`
